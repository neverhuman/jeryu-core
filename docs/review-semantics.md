# Core review semantics and integration boundary

`ForgeCore::create_review` records explicit approvals, changes requests and
comments. Comments preserve the actor's current explicit verdict. Authors cannot
approve their own PR, including through direct Core callers; inherited self
approvals cannot satisfy required approval counts or CODEOWNERS or erase an
earlier rejection.

`ForgeCore::dismiss_review` requires a target UUID, full lowercase SHA-1 current
head and nonempty reason. Only the target's own reviewer may dismiss the current
explicit verdict.
The operation appends a `DISMISSED` event with `dismissed_review_id` and the reason
in `body`. It never changes the target row. Superseded, already-dismissed,
wrong-head and other-actor targets are refused. Generic `event=DISMISSED` review
creation is unsupported. Later explicit decisions can establish a new verdict;
dismissal never recovers an older verdict. Historical target-less dismissals
suppress prior approvals without erasing rejections or inferring targets.

The shared `effective_reviews_for_pull_request` helper must supply both
qualification and consumer posture. The head-only reducer remains available for
audit and target selection. SQLite migration 0016 preserves targets and append
order through reopen and unrelated full-state writes. See `db/constraints.md`
for installation custody and incompatible older writers.

Actor parameters remain raw canonical login strings. The caller must authenticate
their holder and enforce repository access. Existing implicit profile creation
is now inside the validated review transaction and rolls back with it; a profile
does not create an account or authenticate a credential. Generic review creation
still accepts an optional expected head. This change does not establish review
nonces, actor capabilities, credential-revocation serialization, multiple-writer
exclusion, merge recovery or installed authority qualification.

## Required Deploy and Web integration

Before consuming this Core cut, Deploy must map the new `ForgeError::Forbidden`
to 403 in `crates/jeryu-api/src/web/pulls.rs`, `src/github/support.rs`, and
`src/web/workcells_support.rs`. These are exhaustive matches. Its PR posture and
history must use `effective_reviews_for_pull_request`, and the `PullRequestReview`
constructor must include `dismissed_review_id`. The existing COMMENTED history
assertion in `src/web/tests.rs` must expect `effective=false` while preserving
the row and thread. Authentication must come from the actual request holder,
never a submitted actor login.

The new source contract `DismissPullReviewRequest` supplies `expected_head_sha`
and `reason`; the target UUID is a route parameter. Add authenticated native
review-history GET and targeted self-dismissal POST routes using this Core
operation. Required route regressions cover 401, 403, malformed bodies, stale
heads, no administrator override, unchanged history on refusal and matching
posture/history after success. Durable history sequence and complete authority
bindings are still required by the broader program.

Generate contracts from Rust with
`cargo run --locked -p jeryu-readmodel --bin export_contracts` after CI allocation;
do not hand-edit generated output. Include the generated cut and Web typecheck
with the eventual consumer pin. Source changes remain unqualified until these
consumer changes and their tests pass.

## Verification commands

Run in the allocated CI window with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2`:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p jeryu-core --test review_semantics
cargo test --locked -p jeryu-core --lib migration_0016_preserves_unbound_dismissals
cargo test --locked -p jeryu-core
cargo test --locked -p jeryu-readmodel
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
jankurai migrate . --analyze --out target/jankurai/migration-report.json
```

The full governed fast, check, score and security lanes remain required before
acceptance. These commands describe the required checks; they are not receipts.
