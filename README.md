# jeryu-core

Forge/domain truth, git storage, read models, TUI, durable DB migrations.

The `jeryu-core` crate exports object-safe `ForgeReadService` domain contracts
for repository, pull-request, check, protection, and audit reads. Transport
adapters consume those contracts without depending on the concrete `ForgeCore`
store or introducing HTTP types into the domain crate.

This repository was seeded from Jeryu source commit `cbecf7caa0e932c76a341b2521e66e911233860d` by
`ops/split/materialize.py`. It is part of the independent Jeryu split family and keeps source paths
stable where practical so ownership remains auditable; family membership is derived from the
Jeryu authority manifest rather than a count embedded here.

The Phase 12 JeryuCache contract remains documented in `docs/PHASE12_SPEC.md`. Runtime cache/CAS
behavior is owned by the separately released `jeryu-cache` repository; this repository consumes
that boundary through pinned interfaces.
